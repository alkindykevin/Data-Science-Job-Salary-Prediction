## Introduction

The demand for data scientists has been increasing rapidly, and predicting the salary of data science jobs accurately is crucial for both job seekers and employers. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the salary of data science job postings based on various factors such as location, experience, education, etc.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about data science job postings along with their corresponding salaries. The dataset includes features such as job title, company name, location, years of experience, education level, etc.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset and any additional data used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `app/`: Files for deploying the model (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the necessary dependencies for running the project.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Use the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory for automating data preprocessing, model training, and any other tasks.
- Deploy the trained model using the files in the `app/` directory (if applicable).

## Models and Techniques

In this project, various machine learning techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., are explored to build predictive models for salary estimation. Feature engineering and selection techniques are also employed to improve model performance.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), etc. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure robustness and generalization of the models.

## Deployment

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed using web frameworks such as Flask or Django. Deployment files and instructions are provided in the `app/` directory.

## Credits

- This project is inspired by the Kaggle dataset on data science job salary prediction.
- The code and documentation are created by Kevin Alkindy.
